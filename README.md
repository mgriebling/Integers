This module is a reformulation of (parts of) Python's *longobject.c* in Swift.  Optimizations like Karatsuba multiplication and string conversion for power of two base have been omitted.  All errors are mine, of course.

Added algorithms are from Knuth: "The Art Of Computer Programming", Vol 2, section 4.3.1

Ported to Swift by Michael Griebling, 18 July 2015.
